<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A muffin is a chemically-leavened, batter-based bakery product. It's formulation is somewhere in between <br>
a low-ratio cake and quick bread. Muffin batter is typically deposited or placed into deep, small cup-shaped pan before baking. 
<br>This gives the finished product a special “cupcake” or “mushroom-like” shape.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <Li>2 ½ cups graham cracker crumbs</Li>
    <Li>¼ cup white sugar </Li>
    <Li>2 teaspoons baking powder</Li>
    <Li>1 cup whole milk</Li>
    <Li>1 egg, slightly beaten</Li>
    <Li>2 tablespoons honey</Li>
</ul>
<h3>Step-by-step</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 10 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. </li>
